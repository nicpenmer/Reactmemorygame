## Clicky Game

Overview
In this project, I created a simple memory game with React. The goal here was to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Instructions
The application renders a dozen different images from the classic Television Series "Bob's Burgers"

Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The goal is for the user to click on each image only once. 

The user's score is recorded: Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, their correct guess score is incremented. 

If the user clicks on an image they're already clicked on in the current round, their Correct Guess score is reset to 0.

The application keeps track of the user's Best Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new Best Score.
